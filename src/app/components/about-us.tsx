              Our mission is to create a rescue system for the flood-affected people of Bangladesh, where millions suffer and lose everything due to flooding. Not only are lives at stake, but also billions of dollars in goods are damaged and abandoned as a result of inadequate flood management.

            <p className="text-gray-600 text-justify">
              In the heart of Dhaka, we gathered as passionate volunteers to create a website for a flood rescue system in Bangladesh. Our vision was clear: to connect those in need with vital resources.
              <br />
              We brainstormed features like real-time flood updates, a directory of local shelters, and a donation platform. Each of us contributed our unique skills—design, coding, and storytelling—to bring our idea to life.
